            Why are the newlines are rendered correctly in cheat sheet, and what can I do?
        </h3>
        <p>
            This is because the cheat sheet does not render its content raw. Before any newline, you have to add a backslash
            character for it to work (due to the way the module zero-md and MathJax render newlines).
            <br>
            In case you want to do newlines in your $\LaTeX$ formula, you need to put three backslashes instead of two.
            <br>
            <pre>
                \begin{cases}
                    y=2x-4\\\
                    7y-9x+9=0
                \end{cases}
            </pre>
            This will render in a cheat sheet as $\begin{cases}y=2x-4\\7y-9x+9=0\end{cases}$
        </p>

            What am I supposed to do for my cheat sheet to get into the displayed categories in the Cheat Sheet Market (CSM)?
        </h3>
        <p>
            Easy, you just need to have the correct keywords in your cheat sheet's context!
            <br>
            However, they must all be separated by a space;
            <br>
            keywords on this website are conventionally written in kebab-case: words are in lowercase and separated using hyphens (-).
            If you do not respect these conventions, you will get less visibility.
            <br>
            Here are the different keywords that are (or are going to be) implemented in the CSM.
        </p>
        <pre>
            maths (arithmetic, algebra, geometry...)
            physics
            chemistry
            geography
            foreign-languages (english, spanish, german, french...)
            history (france, england, japan, india...)
            geopolitics
            sociology
            economy
            art / art-history...
            cuisine / gastronomy / recipe...
            technology / it...
        </pre>
        <p>
            Do not forget, that you will have to choose wisely your keywords as you will have a limited amount of characters in your cheat sheet's context!
            The better keywords you pick, the quicker you will be found.
